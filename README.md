Week 3 homework assignment UoB bootcamp.
First we had to create new repostries which included the original data in a resource folders and including  a read me
Each repo contains the code as main.py, as well as the output of the analysis as text file. 
Also each repo contains a screenshot of the output to the terminal as a word file. 

In detail, for PyBank we needed to find:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In detail, for PyPoll we needed
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote

Generally I have chosen to keep my code simple, and use hard coding in areas.
